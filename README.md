# 📺 Netflix Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## 📝 Project Overview
In this project, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Netflix Titles dataset**, which contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. The goal was to explore various trends, visualize the data, and generate insights related to genres, release years, ratings, and other features.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For code and visualization)
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy

## 🧩 Project Description
- **Dataset Used:** Netflix Titles Dataset containing details of movies and TV shows available on Netflix.
- **Objective:** To explore and analyze the dataset using EDA techniques, visualizations, and statistical analysis.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Analysis
1. **Most Popular Genres:** Explored the distribution of movie genres on Netflix, finding out which genres are most common.
2. **Content Over Time:** Analyzed the number of Netflix releases over the years and how the content offering has evolved.
3. **Ratings Analysis:** Investigated the distribution of ratings and their correlation with other features like genres and release year.
4. **Content Type Comparison:** Compared the differences between movies and TV shows in terms of runtime, genre, and other features.

## 💡 Project Features:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing data, correcting inconsistent entries, and transforming data types for analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and box plots for visual analysis.
- **Insights and Trends:** Generated insights on trends like the rise of original Netflix content, top genres, and release year distributions.
